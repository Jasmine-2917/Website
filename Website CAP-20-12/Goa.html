Vagator beach is adorned with picturesque red cliffs that look down to two freshwater springs that are a stone’s throw distance from the sea. The beach is mainly divided by a seaside headland which acts as a prime spot for car parking and several small stalls that sell clothes, food and an assortment of trinkets and souvenirs. When facing the sea from the headland, on the right lies the North Vagator Beach or locally known as ‘Big Vagator’, while on the left lies the Ozran Beach or what is known as ‘Little Vagator Beach’.</p>

<p>You can bag the best time of your vacation at Butterfly Beach which is north of Palolem Beach in Southern Goa. Enjoy your solitude, away from the rest of the world and also experience the wonderful aquatic life out in the open front of the beach.

To reach here, you can hop on a ferry from Palolem or Agonda beaches as this beautiful and semi-circled beach is not approachable by any other means. For wider and punctuated experience, you can opt for a ship ride too. And if you are feeling too thrilled, you can try out trekking around the thick forest surrounding this beach. 

Butterfly beach is also popularly known as Honeymoon Beach as a lot of honeymooners and couples come here for a secluded vacation. You can spend your day with your partner by enjoying a picnic with wine. You can also wait for the low tide period to witness wandering Sea urchins, redfish, goldfish, and sea cucumbers here. This is a unique sight that you will not get to explore anywhere else in entire Goa. Moreover, on one side, million butterflies dance and harbour over this beach and on the other, you get to catch a glimpse of dolphins in the middle of the sea.</p>

<p>One of the most important of all tourist places in Goa as well as a central landmark for Catholics, the Bom Jesus Basilica is the place in which the incorrupt body of St Francis Xavier is kept. The Church was built in 1605 and the body of the Saint was brought to it in 1622 where it has laid since in its glass mausoleum. The body is perhaps the greatest attraction of the Basilica. A gallery of Modern Art is also a part of the Basilica.

The building is constructed in baroque style and is considered one of the best examples of baroque architecture in India. You can visit the Bom Jesus Basillica in December for the best experience of the tradition as the feast and novena take place at that time along with Christmas celebrations.</p>

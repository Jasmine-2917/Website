Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Hindu temples at Pattadakal are an effortless blend of North and South Indian architecture. Built-in the 9th century by the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, the Jain Temple is the newest addition of this region. Built by Queen Lokamahadevi, wife of Vikramaditya II, Virupaksha Temple is one of the finest examples of South Indian architecture. These temples offer the town its unique identity.

The various temples that one must visit are Jain temple, Papanatha temple, Galaganath temple, and Sangameshwara temple. The classical dance festival held in January sheds light into the authentic culture and traditions of Pattadakal. Besides tourism, delicious food is another highlight of this heritage town.</p>

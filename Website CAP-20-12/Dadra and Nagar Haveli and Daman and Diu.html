Published: 07 Jul, 2018 Shefali Sinha

People often plan a vacation to Goa but for those who seek tranquility, Daman Diu will be a coastal paradise for them. Even though the destinations are a part of a single union territory, Daman and Diu have a geographical distance of about 650-700 km. Mostly you’d find people of Gujarat as well as Maharashtra spending their weekend at this serene destination, the reason being the close proximity from these two states. The influence of Portuguese culture in Daman and Diu is what fascinates the travellers the most, one is offered a great deal of food, crafts and stunning architecture. The best time to visit this place is during October-April, however, if you are a beach lover, you can plan your trip to Daman and Diu anytime of the year you like. Here is the list of must do things and places to visit in Daman and Diu to make most of your holiday in this gorgeous union territory.

Diu Fort Dating back to 1535 when Portuguese thought of staying India, they built this marvel. Standing still and portraying the greatness of Portugal rulers, this fort bathes in sunlight and glows in the moonlight and stays beside the enormous Arabian Sea each day. The existence of a huge lighthouse beside the fort adds another dimension to the panoramic view of the surrounding. The presence of various arms and the intelligence of Portuguese engineers have proved that strength is not always depicted by the existence of tangible substance but with the power of the mind. This brilliance of the engineers could be seen at the fort’s design. They used water for strengthening the fort’s base. This is a must visit spot for witnessing the panoramic view of the Arabian Sea.</p>

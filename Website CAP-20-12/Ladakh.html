<p>Located at an elevation of 14,000 feet, Magnetic Hill in Ladakh is one of the most mysterious and intriguing places to visit in the country. This small cyclops hillock is said to be a place where the forces of gravity are defied, as it is here where vehicles seem to be pulled in an upwards direction on the hill. While there are several scientific theories that could debunk the mystery of this unique phenomenon, there is also the rather common local superstition, that states that the Magnetic Hill Road is a direct “stairway to heaven.”

The road to Magnetic Hill is home to a signboard that reads, “Magnetic Hill – the Phenomenon that defies Gravity,” along with a white box that asks you to park your vehicle there. Upon parking your vehicle in neutral gear, you can eventually see them moving uphill at a speed of around 10 to 20 km/hr, all by itself, against the force of gravity. 

Some of the more scientific and practical theories surrounding the Magnetic Hill is that of the Optical Illusion, wherein people believe that even if the slope of the hill is in a downward direction, it tends to appear upright due to its unique terrain, thereby making it look like the vehicle is going uphill. 

Alternatively, there is the theory of the Magnetic Force of the Earth, which suggests that the magnetic forces of the earth’s interiors pull the vehicles uphill. 

This is one such phenomenon that has attracted tourists from all over the globe to Magnetic Hill. Regardless of the reason, Magnetic Hill is surely a great place to visit, in addition to being a good pitstop on the Manali-Leh Highway, in addition to a good place to click stunning photos, relax and unwind, or simply soak in the lap of nature.</p>

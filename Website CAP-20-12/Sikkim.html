While coming down the slope around 300 feet from Donkiala pass ( 18300 feet ), you can get the first sight of this moderately sized, almost frozen lake. Cholamu Lake is only a few kms away from the Tibet border and is off limits for commonplace tourists. One needs special permits, from Army and Sikkim police/administration to visit the Cholamu Lake.

Also know as Tso Lhamo lake, it is difficult to get permission to visit this lake and it is advisable not to visit this place in monsoons or winters. If you are on a family trip avoid visiting Cholamu Lake and visit the Gurudongmar Lake instead. However, if weather permits, and you get a permit easily then opt for Cholamu Lake. Since mostly no travel agencies risk their vehicles and driver in this risky terrain you can trek up to this stunning lake. The world does not have too many such places with more sublime associations than this calm sheet of water, 17,000 feet above the sea, with the shadows of mountains 22,000 to 24,000 feet high, resting on its surface.</p>

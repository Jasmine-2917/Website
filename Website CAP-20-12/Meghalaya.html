<h2><li id="li3">Double Decker Living Root Bridge</li></h2><br><br>
<img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/b0/31/f4/the-beaut.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1" border=5 width=380 height=240><br>
<p>If you want to start your Meghalaya trip with something awe-inspiring, the Double Decker Living Root Bridge (Umshiang), nestled in the verdant forests of Cherrapunji, fits the bill perfectly. Suspended at a height of 2400 feet and 3 km in length, this iconic bridge was created by joining the roots of two ancient rubber trees. The creative credit goes to the Khasis, who “train” the roots of many such trees (for 10 to 15 years) to grow in a way so that bridges can be formed. Umshiang Root Bridge, however, is the most well-known, owing to its size and the astonishing way it marries science and nature. It is also robust enough for you to cross the quietly flowing Umshiang River.     </p>

<h2><li>Elephant Falls</li></h2><br><br>
<img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/ElephantFalls,Shillong_20190725123905.jpg" border=5 width=380 height=240><br>
<p>Originally named after a rock that resembled an elephant, during the British era, this stunning waterfall is composed of three falls. While the first fall is a broad one and concealed by trees, the second one is weak. However, the third one catches the eye with milky white water happily cascading over rocks that are covered in fern. With thick vegetation on either side, Elephant Falls can be accessed by carefully descending along slippery and steep steps. The good news is that, you will find benches at the first and second level of the waterfall, where you can unwind, click pictures and soak in nature’s unparalleled beauty.  </p>

<br>

<h2><li>Umngot River</li></h2><br><br>
<img src="https://english.mathrubhumi.com/image/contentid/policy:1.5903286:1645111333/image.jpg?q=0.6&$p$q=74bc07c" border=5 width=380 height=240><br>
<p>At a time when the world is battling with pollution, getting the chance to see a crystal-clear river where boats seem to float in mid-air is sheer good fortune. Umngot River, reflecting the lush greenery on either side, is like a fairyland where you can spot colourful fishes without diving into the cool waters. The pebbled bed of the river is effortlessly visible to the naked eye too. You can go boating or kayaking to find out how it feels to glide over glassy waters or camp on a bank. Flanked by Khasi and Jaintia hills, the emerald-green river sparkles magically under the sun. If you take a boat ride, you might also come across secret alcoves and short streams in the hills on either side, while you listen to the twitter of birds. No wonder, it is among the best places to see in Meghalaya.     </p>

<h2><li> Mawlynnong Village</li></h2><br><br>

<h2><li> Umian Lake</li></h2><br><br>
<img src="https://www.trawell.in/admin/images/upload/648495950Shillong_Umiam_Lake_Main.jpg" border=5 width=380 height=240><br>
<p>Created in the early 1960s, by building a dam over the Umiam River, Umiam Lake is essentially a reservoir with breathtaking surroundings.

The water of the lake is not only used for generating electricity, but also for irrigation, drinking purposes and fisheries.  </p> 

<br>

<h2><li>Nohkalikai Waterfalls</li></h2><br><br>
<img src="https://d2gt5azlc10ehh.cloudfront.net/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/india_nohkalikai_waterfall-678x381.jpg" border=5 width=380 height=240><br>
<p>Boasting a height of 115 feet, Nohkalikai Falls is known to be India’s tallest plunge waterfall and one of the most beautiful places in Meghalaya. A gem that is nestled in the green lap of East Khasi Hills, the waterfall descends from a plateau and is fed by rain. It forms a gorgeous green pool at the bottom, which can be accessed via a flight of stairs. It is a sight to behold, especially when the plateau is shrouded with mist. The legend associated with the waterfall is a heartbreaking one though, which probably makes its beauty surreal. It is believed that Likai, a woman who remarried after her husband’s death, could not shower her second husband with enough love as she used to be preoccupied with her daughter. Driven by jealousy and anger, the second husband killed the little girl and cooked a meal with her flesh, which Likai, unknowingly, consumed after a gruelling day. But, when realisation dawned on her, she jumped to her death from the place where the Nohkalikai Waterfalls originates.</p>

<p>Overwhelming is the best word to describe what you will feel when you visit Dainthlen Falls, where gorgeous white water plunges from a height of 90m, in all its foamy beauty. It not only makes for amazing pictures, but the tricky walk that takes you to the viewpoint is also exciting. A bridge has been built over the stream formed by this waterfall, which you can cross or use as a backdrop for photography sessions. The legend associated with the falls is also unique. It is believed that once upon a time, Thlen, a massive demonic python, was terrorising the locality with its power and greed. However, a few men, brave of heart, caught the serpent and used a large stone to destroy its hood near this waterfall. In fact, you can find snake carvings on the rocks in the area, acting as a reminder of the price that greed and evil have to pay.   </p>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Ward%27s_Lake.jpg" border=5 width=380 height=240><br>
